This library for work with stack.
Description:
1) Stack implemented on a unidirectional list.
2) The number of stacks is unlimited.
3) You can create a stack for storing an element of any size.
4) Good for storing elements with large size since
	the elements are passed through pointers.	
5) Function memcpy() is used to copy elements of any size
	but if you know the size of the elements you can replace it
	with a function to work with this element but you will lose
	the ability to create stacks with elements of
	a different size but will win the speed of the program.
